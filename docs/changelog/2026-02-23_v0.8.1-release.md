# 2026-02-23 v0.8.1 Release Prep

## Session Goal

Cut and publish `v0.8.1` from `develop` with changelog and release-notes updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Bump
- Updated crate version:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `0.8.0` -> `0.8.1`

### 2. Changelog Release Cut
- Added `## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-23` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Captured release-scoped changes:
  - Jump label digits (`0-9`)
  - Viewport-aware Jump Mode target allocation
  - Focus-aware reserved jump keys (`c/r/q` in Content, `r/q` in Sidebar/Topbar)
  - ScreenDiff incremental update path in release line
  - Startup/render stability and runtime log-noise reductions
- Updated changelog version links:
  - `Unreleased` compare base -> `v0.8.1`
  - Added `[0.8.1]` release link

### 3. Release Notes
- Created:
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.8.1.md`
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_SUMMARY_v0.8.1.md`
- Updated release index:
  - `docs/release-notes/README.md` marks `v0.8.1` as latest.

## Verification Plan

Run:

```bash
source ~/.cargo/env && cargo build -q && cargo test -q
```

Then:
- commit release changes
- create annotated tag `v0.8.1`
- push `develop` and tag
