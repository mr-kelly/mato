# 2026-02-23 v0.8.1 Release Prep

## Session Goal

Cut and publish `v0.8.1` from `develop` with changelog and release-notes updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Bump
- Updated crate version:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `0.8.0` -> `0.8.1`

### 2. Changelog Release Cut
- Added `## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-23` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Captured release-scoped changes:
  - Jump label digits (`0-9`)
  - Viewport-aware Jump Mode target allocation
  - Focus-aware reserved jump keys (`c/r/q` in Content, `r/q` in Sidebar/Topbar)
  - ScreenDiff incremental update path in release line
  - Startup/render stability and runtime log-noise reductions
- Updated changelog version links:
  - `Unreleased` compare base -> `v0.8.1`
  - Added `[0.8.1]` release link

### 3. Release Notes
- Created:
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.8.1.md`
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_SUMMARY_v0.8.1.md`
- Updated release index:
  - `docs/release-notes/README.md` marks `v0.8.1` as latest.

## Verification Plan

Run:

```bash
source ~/.cargo/env && cargo build -q && cargo test -q
```

Then:
- commit release changes
- push `main`
- allow CI workflow to create tag and GitHub Release

## Rule Update (Postmortem)

- Updated `AGENTS.md` release rules to match actual CI behavior:
  - `main` release tags and GitHub Releases are CI-owned.
  - Manual `vX.Y.Z` tag/release creation is prohibited.
  - Release process now explicitly says: bump version, push `main`, let CI create tag/release.
- Reason: a manually created `v0.8.1` tag caused `Validate tag policy` to fail in `Release / Tag and Create Release` and prevented release publication.

## Session Update: Tagline Consistency

- Updated slogan wording for consistency and readability:
  - `README.md`: `Managing hundreds of AI agents from the command line.` -> `Managing hundreds of AI agents from your terminal.`
  - `website/app/(home)/page.tsx`: `Managing hundreds of AI agents from the command line.` -> `Managing hundreds of AI agents from your terminal.`
- Verified active tagline occurrences now match in both README and website homepage.

## Session Update: Website Install UX + Contributor Guidance

### Homepage / Website
- Refactored homepage to follow native Fumadocs UI patterns and reduce custom styling surface:
  - `website/app/(home)/page.tsx`
  - `website/app/global.css`
  - `website/components/home/install-tabs.tsx`
- Install section updates:
  - Moved install block directly below hero.
  - Added clear tabs: `For AI Agent` and `For Human`.
  - Added copy-friendly command/prompt blocks with improved spacing.
  - Updated install script URL to `http://mato.sh/install.sh`.
- Added dynamic version badge component:
  - `website/components/home/version-badge.tsx`
  - Reads `/version.txt` and links to the matching GitHub release tag page.
- Mobile layout polish:
  - Added horizontal breathing room on key bordered sections.
  - Reduced edge-clipping/visual crowding on small screens.

### Documentation / README
- Expanded Quick Start installation guidance for both humans and AI agents.
- Added a dedicated contributor-facing section:
  - `Development with Coding Agents`
  - Includes a reusable prompt for clone -> implement -> test -> docs -> conventional commits -> PR flow.
  - Explicitly states no issue creation is required for this workflow.
- Philosophy wording now explicitly references traditional terminal multiplexers (`tmux/screen`) where relevant.

### Release Workflow Docs
- Clarified CI-owned release behavior in release workflow documentation:
  - `docs/agents/RELEASE_GUIDE.md`
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` validation behavior alignment.

## Session Update: README Refresh + UX Fixes + v0.9.0 Bump

### 1) README Positioning Refresh
- Reworked top-level README structure toward a feature-first flow:
  - Renamed `Showcase` section to `Features`.
  - Removed standalone `Premium Features` section and merged its messaging into feature cards.
  - Removed repeated `Image description:` label text for cleaner reading.
- Refined navigation links and section naming:
  - `Pro Resources` -> `Resources`.
  - Added clearer contributor path under `Development with Coding Agents`.
- Added `Fast Contribute (3 steps)`:
  - clone + branch
  - build/test
  - conventional commit + PR
- Updated CTA wording:
  - `Report a Bug / Request a Feature` (single Issues entrypoint).
- Moved `Pronunciation` section before `Resources` and out of centered footer block.

### 2) Media / Visual Assets
- Replaced README hero image with coding-focused APNG:
  - `docs/images/screenshot-coding.png`
- Added and wired a dedicated office screenshot filename:
  - `docs/images/screenshot-office.png` (renamed from `screenshot-0.png`)
- Added multiple feature GIF/PNG assets for README feature cards:
  - spinner, multi-client sync, onboarding, daemon persistence, mouse/jump visuals.
- Generated APNG composites:
  - `docs/images/screenshot-onboarding.png` (5 frames, 1s per frame)
  - `docs/images/screenshot-coding.png`
  - `docs/images/screenshot-themes.png`
- Added `Jump Mode` and `Customizable Themes` as explicit feature cards in README.

### 3) Version
- Bumped crate version:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `0.8.1` -> `0.9.0`

### 4) Runtime UX / Input Behavior Fixes
- Desk close flow changed to explicit confirmation:
  - Sidebar `x` now opens a yes/no confirm dialog (`y`/`Enter` to confirm, `n`/`Esc` to cancel).
  - Tab close (`Topbar x`) remains immediate (no confirmation), by design.
- Fixed `Content` focus `Esc-Esc` bell issue:
  - Root cause: first `Esc` was immediately forwarded to shell, causing downstream BEL in some programs.
  - New behavior:
    - Delay single `Esc` forwarding briefly.
    - `Esc-Esc` within window enters Jump Mode without forwarding an `Esc` to shell.
    - Single `Esc` still forwards after timeout or before subsequent non-Esc key.

### 5) Validation
- Verified with:
```bash
source ~/.cargo/env && cargo build -q
source ~/.cargo/env && cargo test -q
pnpm -C website types:check
```
