# 2026-02-23 v0.8.1 Release Prep

## Session Goal

Cut and publish `v0.8.1` from `develop` with changelog and release-notes updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Bump
- Updated crate version:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `0.8.0` -> `0.8.1`

### 2. Changelog Release Cut
- Added `## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-23` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Captured release-scoped changes:
  - Jump label digits (`0-9`)
  - Viewport-aware Jump Mode target allocation
  - Focus-aware reserved jump keys (`c/r/q` in Content, `r/q` in Sidebar/Topbar)
  - ScreenDiff incremental update path in release line
  - Startup/render stability and runtime log-noise reductions
- Updated changelog version links:
  - `Unreleased` compare base -> `v0.8.1`
  - Added `[0.8.1]` release link

### 3. Release Notes
- Created:
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.8.1.md`
  - `docs/release-notes/RELEASE_SUMMARY_v0.8.1.md`
- Updated release index:
  - `docs/release-notes/README.md` marks `v0.8.1` as latest.

## Verification Plan

Run:

```bash
source ~/.cargo/env && cargo build -q && cargo test -q
```

Then:
- commit release changes
- push `main`
- allow CI workflow to create tag and GitHub Release

## Rule Update (Postmortem)

- Updated `AGENTS.md` release rules to match actual CI behavior:
  - `main` release tags and GitHub Releases are CI-owned.
  - Manual `vX.Y.Z` tag/release creation is prohibited.
  - Release process now explicitly says: bump version, push `main`, let CI create tag/release.
- Reason: a manually created `v0.8.1` tag caused `Validate tag policy` to fail in `Release / Tag and Create Release` and prevented release publication.

## Session Update: Tagline Consistency

- Updated slogan wording for consistency and readability:
  - `README.md`: `Managing hundreds of AI agents from the command line.` -> `Managing hundreds of AI agents from your terminal.`
  - `website/app/(home)/page.tsx`: `Managing hundreds of AI agents from the command line.` -> `Managing hundreds of AI agents from your terminal.`
- Verified active tagline occurrences now match in both README and website homepage.

## Session Update: Website Install UX + Contributor Guidance

### Homepage / Website
- Refactored homepage to follow native Fumadocs UI patterns and reduce custom styling surface:
  - `website/app/(home)/page.tsx`
  - `website/app/global.css`
  - `website/components/home/install-tabs.tsx`
- Install section updates:
  - Moved install block directly below hero.
  - Added clear tabs: `For AI Agent` and `For Human`.
  - Added copy-friendly command/prompt blocks with improved spacing.
  - Updated install script URL to `http://mato.sh/install.sh`.
- Added dynamic version badge component:
  - `website/components/home/version-badge.tsx`
  - Reads `/version.txt` and links to the matching GitHub release tag page.
- Mobile layout polish:
  - Added horizontal breathing room on key bordered sections.
  - Reduced edge-clipping/visual crowding on small screens.

### Documentation / README
- Expanded Quick Start installation guidance for both humans and AI agents.
- Added a dedicated contributor-facing section:
  - `Development with Coding Agents`
  - Includes a reusable prompt for clone -> implement -> test -> docs -> conventional commits -> PR flow.
  - Explicitly states no issue creation is required for this workflow.
- Philosophy wording now explicitly references traditional terminal multiplexers (`tmux/screen`) where relevant.

### Release Workflow Docs
- Clarified CI-owned release behavior in release workflow documentation:
  - `docs/agents/RELEASE_GUIDE.md`
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` validation behavior alignment.
